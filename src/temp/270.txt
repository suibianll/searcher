DBWorld Message ICST 2019: CALL FOR PAPERS

The 12th IEEE International Conference on Software Testing, Verification, and Validation




22-27 April 2019, Xi��an, China

http://icst2019.xjtu.edu.cn




�������������������������������������������������������������������������������������







ICST 2019 invites high quality submissions in all areas of software testing, verification, and validation. Papers for the research track should present novel and original work that pushes the state-of-the-art. Case studies and empirical research papers are also welcome.




Topics of interest include, but is not limited to, the following:




�� Domain specific testing, such as: mobile or web app testing, embedded systems testing, concurrent systems, GUI testing, etc.

�� Formal verification

�� Model based testing

�� Model checking

�� Manual testing practices and techniques

�� Search based software testing

�� Security testing

�� Software reliability

�� Test automation

�� Testability and design

�� Testing and development processes

�� Testing education

�� Testing in specific domains, such as mobile, web, embedded, concurrent, distributed, cloud, and real-time systems

�� Testing/debugging tools

�� Theory of software testing

�� Empirical studies

�� Experience reports

Industry track




The industry track has the same topics and requires the same rigorousness as the research track. However, the industry track papers should prioritize impact and realism over novelty. We expect that industry track publications report useful testing tools, successful stories and experiences when applying software testing theories and methodologies into practice, or promising prototypes that have the potential to impact practice in the next few years. Ideally they should be evaluated on real-world, industrial data, and discuss non-functional aspects such as scalability and reliability, and also compare to pre-existing industrial best practices. The industry track papers will be published in the ICST 2019 proceedings and listed by IEEE databases.

PhD Symposium




The symposium invites PhD students at all stages of their studies, from first year students to those ready for their final dissertation defense. Each student needs to write a short research summary and make a public presentation at the symposium. After the public presentation, students will receive oral feedback from a panel of researchers and practitioners. Students may also seek advice on topics such as how to perform research in testing, how to design and execute empirical research, write scientific papers, and eventually prepare for the defense itself. Accepted research summaries will be published in the conference proceedings.

A limited number of travel grants are available to PhD students. Priority will be based on need and date of submission. Please indicate your interest in being considered for a travel grant along with your submission.

Testing Tool Track




The ICST Tool Papers Track seeks to bridge the gap between software testing, verification, and validation practitioners and researchers with a goal of improving both the state-of-the-art and the state-of-the-practice. In their submissions, researchers should explain how they deal with the complexity and challenges of transferring research ideas into practice. Researchers are welcome to submit papers in which they describe how academic research helps tool developers to apply new approaches for solving complex real industry problems. Novel techniques and tools will be exposed to the Tools Track participants, which will be connected with potential collaborators. This track enables leading researchers and practitioners to discuss how important practical problems can be solved.

Workshops, and Other Events at ICST 2019




ICST 2019 will also host the following events:




- Test competition on applying learnt testing techniques to overcome industrial challenges

- Tools and Demo trackx to explain and showcase practical tools

- Workshops on specific areas related to testing, validation, and verification

How to Submit




Full Research Papers as well as Industry papers must conform to the two-column IEEE conference publication format. Templates for LaTeX and Microsoft Word are available from http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html: please use the letter format template and conference option.




Papers should be submitted in the PDF format: they must not exceed ten pages, plus up to two pages of references. Submissions will be handled via https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icst2019.

Double Blind




ICST 2019 is adopting Double Blind Reviewing: research track submissions should not reveal the identity of author(s) in any way; names and affiliations should be left out. Authors should also ensure that citations to their own work are written in third person (i.e. do not write ��our previous work��; use ��the previous work of X��).
