The Digital Institute at Newcastle University has five openings in its Research Software Engineering Team. The team works across the whole university and with a range of external partners including the Alan Turing Institute. We develop high-quality software in collaboration with scientists, engineers and scholars from all research domains. You will be responsible for delivering technical software engineering expertise across multiple simultaneous projects.

You will have an MSc in a computationally based field (equivalent experience or close to completion), as well as proven experience of software development. We are especially interested in interviewing candidates with experience in any of the following areas: Cloud Computing Visualization, Geospatial or Temporal Statistics, Functional Programming and Machine Learning.

Applications are welcome from both software development generalists and from researchers with inter-disciplinary technology focused skills which either complement or extend our existing team.

If you are looking to apply your skills into research, we would love to hear from you.

The Digital Institute’s goal is to transform research at Newcastle through the application of digital skills and technology. Its work spans research, teaching and innovation through engagement with external organisations. As a team we work across the university and with every academic discipline. Whether this means scaling GPU rendering of city-scale models across thousands of nodes in the cloud, creating new digital editions to breathe new life into medieval texts, helping researchers gain insight into human movement by running gait analysis algorithms at scale, or working to help optimise the UK energy network – we do it all.

We bring specialist programming expertise, modern development practices and engineering rigour to academic software. We provide expert software engineering consulting services to world-leading research teams, and collaborate with scientists and scholars to build software to meet the next generation of research challenges.

There are 5, full time posts available which are fixed term for 24 months from date of appointment.
