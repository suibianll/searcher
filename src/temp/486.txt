FUZZ-IEEE 2019 - 3rd edition of Business Processes and Fuzzy Logic (BPFL) Organized by Mario Luca Bernardi, Marta Cimitile, Giuseppe De Ruvo FUZZ-IEEE 2019 - Special Sessions Business processes are a formal and well-defined representation of enterprise activities, capable of highlighting, in a structured way, how multiple complex tasks are performed within a given organization. This representation enables a more clear understanding of interactions occurring within a company with a consequent and improved collaboration among all the stakeholders involved in a given technical or administrative process. In the last years, several techniques for business process management have been introduced to efficiently discover, monitor and execute business processes in different enterprise scenarios. However, these techniques could fail when processes are not carefully designed and optimized, when they quickly change over time or when they refer to highly uncertain and vague contexts. Consequently, fuzzy logic and approximate rule-based reasoning can efficiently support tools for business process management in facing aforementioned challenges. Specifically, fuzzy theory could play an important role for clustering, data analysis, data fusion, pattern recognition, modeling, multi-criteria evaluation and, more in general, for several business intelligence approaches. Fuzzy theories can be also combined with other techniques such as neural nets and evolutionary computing and applied to both business process design and management approaches as well as to complex process analysis focused on the extraction and representation of hidden knowledge. The objective of this special session is to provide a forum for the discussion of recent research trends in the application of fuzzy set methodology and technology to business process management problems and to offer an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to identify and discuss about new promising research directions in this challenging scenario. Scope and Topics The objective of this special session is to provide a forum for the discussion of recent research trends in the application of fuzzy set methodology and technology to business process management problems and to offer an opportunity for researchers and practitioners to identify and discuss about new promising research directions in this challenging scenario. The topics include but are not limited to: Business intelligence; Fuzzy Logic for Adaptive and Context-Aware process execution; Fuzzy Logic for effective analytics and visualization of enterprise processes; Fuzzy models supporting business process management approaches; Offline and Online process mining approaches dealing with uncertainty; Fuzzy-based qualitative and quantitative process analysis; Using Fuzzy theories to for process querying, refactoring, searching and versioning; Fuzzy models to represent process data; Fuzzy models to perform process integration; Fuzzy models and data mining approaches for process management; Fuzzy-based frameworks specific for business process representation and modeling; Case studies and empirical evaluations. Notes Papers submitted for special sessions will be peer-reviewed with the same criteria used for the rest of contributed papers. As a result, all accepted papers will be included in the proceedings of FUZZ-IEEE 2019.
