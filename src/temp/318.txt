Satellite Session T.T.M. 2019 - Terminology and Text Mining [http://toth.condillac.org/ttm-2019]
in parallel with the TOTh Conference [http://toth.condillac.org/conference]

Thursday 6 June 2019 (2:00 pm - 6:00 pm)

The aim of the Satellite �Terminology and Text Mining� (TTM�2019) Session, open to the different TOTh communities, is to discuss the advantages and limits of text mining approaches in research which include terminological resources in relation to domains and applications. This Satellite Session will present and discuss text mining approaches used to build and update terminologies, lexica, dictionaries, ontologies and thesauri. It will show how these terminology-driven approaches can be relevant for dedicated tasks (automatic processing of mono- and multilingual content, information retrieval, classification, information extraction, named entity identification, disambiguation, etc.). The TTM-TOTh�2019 Session aims to include a wide range of specialists including linguists, computer scientists and NLP experts.
