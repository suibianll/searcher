Workshop on Designing Crowd-powered Creativity Support Systems (DC2S2)
Web: https://dc2s2.github.io/2019/
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In conjunction with CHI'19, 4th-9th May 2019, Glasgow, Scotland
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Workshop Overview
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Supporting creativity has been considered as one of the grand challenges in Human Computer Interaction (HCI). The goal of creativity support systems is to make "more people more creative more often". By creativity, we refer to the process that leads to an artifact that is deemed both novel and useful in a given field and domain. Crowdsourcing is the practice of outsourcing tasks on an online platform to a crowd of people via an open call for contributions. Given the inherent emphasis of crowdsourcing in collecting insights rapidly, inexpensively and accurately, crowdsourcing has been suggested as a key approach for creativity support. Organizations have recognized the potential of crowds, with companies such as Innocentive, Quirky and OpenIDEO finding success in Open Innovation.
In this one-day workshop at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'19), we bring together scientists and practitioners interested in creativity. We invite participants working on collaborative and crowd-powered systems that in one way or another enhance creative processes or challenge the academic community’s thinking and perceptions about creativity in general. Doing so, we set to inspire the design of next-generation crowd-powered systems that support creativity. The workshop allows for participants to bring forward their ideas, designs and practical experiences in the field of supporting creativity through crowdsourcing.

Topics of Interest
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As creativity can be an attribute of individuals or teams, we will center the workshop around the following two themes as a broad estimate of the type of system designs that we hope to stimulate with the workshop: augmenting the individual, and supporting group collaboration.
Topics of interest for this first workshop on augmenting the individual, and supporting group collaboration, include but are not limited to the following topics: should we add other topics?
* Augmenting the Individual
- Interfaces and software for supporting peak-productive moments ("bursts") of an individual's creativity with the collective intelligence of the crowd
- Preventing cognitive overload of the individual: Evaluating the quality of contributions from the crowd and helping explore the space of solutions contributed by the crowd
* Supporting Group Ideation
- Determining levels of collaboration to prevent early fixation of the group without limiting the quality through feedback
- Dynamically guiding crowd efforts based on task needs, worker profiles, etc.
- Automating repetitive tasks in group ideation
