Blockchain @ SACMAT'19: First International Workshop on Blockchains and 
Distributed Ledger Technologies @ ACM SACMAT 2019. 

Toronto, Canada. June 3, 2019
https://blockchain-conf.github.io/

OBJECTIVES:
The objective of this one-day workshop is to bring blockchain researchers and 
practitioners together and discuss opportunities to exploit blockchain and DLTs
across a variety of application domains.  Furthermore, this workshop will also 
examine the state-of-art in blockchain research, and challenges to be solved in
order to improve usability and adoption of the technology.

The workshop aims to provide a balanced outlook and is designed for wide 
audience of industrial and academic participants. There will be a broad range 
of talks to cater to both beginners and advanced blockchain users. Furthermore, 
the talks will range from applications and experiences using DLTs to 
theoretical, technical, and system-oriented topics.

STRUCTURE:
We are soliciting participants to present their work at the workshop. We are 
looking for (but are not limited to) the following types of talks:
1) Presentations of previously published conference or journal articles at 
   other venues
2) Presentations on ongoing, unpublished, research (in order to be part of 
   the SACMAT proceedings, please submit to the main conference -- deadline 
   February 10 -- and email the workshop chair)
3) Presentations on the design, implementation, and evaluation of novel use
   cases for blockchains
4) Presentations on adoption roadmap, technical and non-technical barriers, 
   especially in industry
5) Presentations of vision/blue-sky topics or position papers
6) Presentations on non-technical aspects related to blockchains (e.g. 
   cryptocurrency mining, exchanges, etc.)

TOPICS COVERED INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO:
1) Integration of access control technologies with DLTs
2) Cryptography mechanisms for blockchains
3) Application domains for blockchains (e.g., eHealth, IoT, supply chains, real
   estate, etc.)
4) Scalability and performance of blockchain systems
5) Security, privacy, and trust in blockchains
6) Consensus mechanisms (e.g., Proof-of-work, Proof-of-stake, PBFT, Merkle DAG, 
   etc.)
7) On-going research in popular blockchain systems (e.g. Ethereum, Hyperledger, 
   etc.)
8) Layer 2 and off-chain solutions (e.g., State channels, Plasma)
9) Smart contract languages, modeling, and verification
10) Theory, cryptoeconomy, and attacks of blockchain systems
