11th International Workshop on Theory and Practice of Provenance
(in cooperation with USENIX)
================================================================

* Date:  exact date TBD but will be sometime during the week of June 3-7, 2019 as part of the Philadelphia Logic Week: https://sites.sju.edu/plw/

* Venue: Saint Josephâ€™s University, Philadelphia, PA, USA


The Theory and Practice of Provenance workshop series was started in San Francisco in 2009. TaPP aims to be a venue for early-stage and innovative research ideas related to provenance, and a forum to encourage exchange of ideas between researchers working on provenance and practitioners or potential users of such research. Industry and academic participants interested in provenance in any setting are welcome, and workshop contributions describing unsolved problems or new potential application areas for provenance research are particularly welcome. 

CALL FOR PAPERS
===============

TaPP 2019 continues the tradition of providing a genuine workshop environment for discussing and developing new ideas and exploring connections between disciplines and between academic research on provenance and practical applications.

We invite innovative and creative contributions, including papers outlining new challenges for provenance research, promising formal approaches to provenance, innovative use of provenance, experience-based insights, resourceful experiments, and visionary (and possibly risky) ideas. Proposals for tutorials, panel or group discussions, reports on early stage research, or any other activities that will create a successful workshop are encouraged.


TOPICS
======
Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Provenance management system prototypes and commercial solutions
- Provenance analytics, querying, and reasoning about provenance
- Visualizing provenance information
- Performance aspects of provenance capture, storage, and analytics
- Standardization of provenance models and representations
- Security and privacy implications of provenance
- Applications of provenance in real life settings
- Human interaction with provenance
- Retroactive reconstruction of provenance
- Using provenance for evaluating data quality and trust in data
- Novel methods for capturing provenance
- Integrating provenance information
- Interoperability among provenance-aware systems
- Provenance discovery
