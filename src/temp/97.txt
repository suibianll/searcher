   database systems, computer security, and modelling.
� Particular educational innovations, such as MOOCs, flipped-classroom,
   game-based education, and E-Learning.
� Specific groups of students, such as first years, women, masters students,
   minorities, impaired students.
� Broader topics, such as curriculum, group-work, assessment,
   class infrastructure.


Submissions 

Original and unpublished submissions in all areas related to computing
education are invited in the following categories:

Colocation with ISSEP 2019

CSERC�19 co-locates with the 12th International Conference on Informatics
in Schools: Situation, Evolution and Perspectives (ISSEP 2019). ISSEP is a
forum for researchers and practitioners in the area of Informatics education,
in both primary and secondary schools. It provides an opportunity for
educators to reflect upon the goals and objectives of this subject matter,
its curricula and various teaching/learning paradigms and topics, possible
connections to everyday life and various ways of developing Informatics
Education in schools. Combining CSERC and ISSEP provides a unique
opportunity for educational researchers and practitioners to get a broad
and comprehensive overview of educational research initiatives taking place
at primary and secondary schools as well as higher education.
