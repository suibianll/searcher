ICTERI 2019 Scope and Structure
ICTERI is an annual peer-reviewed international Computer Science conference focusing on research advances and business/academic applications of Information and Communication Technologies, design, development, and deployment of advanced information systems and ICT Infrastructures. The emphasis is put on real world applications of ICT-based solutions. Therefore, all contributions are strongly encouraged to demonstrate how and to what purpose the proposed solutions are used or transferred into use. Examples of such contributions are a proof-of-concept implementation; prototype in an advanced stage; case study involving new tools and/or methodological approaches; experimental studies with real use cases, including knowledge or technology transfer; visionary papers or surveys revealing new needs and trends. Reports on academic-industrial partnerships for ICT innovation and knowledge transfer are as welcome as technological and methodological submissions.
Besides the main technical programme, ICTERI 2019 will host a number of workshops on topics related to the general theme of the conference. The role of the workshops is to provide a platform for a more intensive scientific exchange amongst researchers interested in a deeper look into a particular topic and as a meeting point for the community. 
We call for half day or full day Workshop Proposals, which contribute to the enrichment of the ICTERI Thematic Track topics*: 
– Track 1: Advances in ICT Research 
– Track 2: Information Systems: Technology and  Applications
– Track 3: Academia/Industry ICT Cooperation
– Track 4: ICT in Education

WORKSHOP PROPOSALS
Workshops should provide forums for discussion among researchers and practitioners on focused topics or emerging research areas. Organizers may structure workshops as they see fit, possibly including invited talks, panel discussions, presentations of work in progress, fully peer-reviewed papers, or some combination. Workshops could be scheduled for a half of a day or a full day, depending on interest, space constraints, and organizer preference. Organizers should design workshops for approximately 15-30 participants to balance impact and effective discussion.
In order to meet these goals, workshops should address the topics meeting the following criteria:
-	The topic falls in the general scope of ICTERI 2019 – please see below
-	There is a clear focus on a specific theme, technology, problem, or application
-	There is a sufficiently large audience interested in the topic
The organizers of accepted workshops have to prepare a workshop webpage containing a call for papers and detailed information about the workshop organization and timelines. The organizers of successful workshops will be responsible for:
-	Their own reviewing process
-	Publicity (e.g., website, etc.)
The organizers of the accepted workshops will be required to cooperate closely with the ICTERI 2019 program chairs and local organizers to finalize all mentioned details and ensure a successful co-located event.
Recommended Structure of a Proposal
It is strongly suggested that a Workshop Proposal includes:
-	The name and acronym of the workshop
-	The duration of the workshop – half day or full day
-	The abstract describing the proposed workshop for publishing (if accepted) at the conference website. The length of the abstract is circa 200 words. 
-	The description of the theme of the workshop. The list of the topics of interest. The description of the relation between the theme of the workshop and ICTERI 2019 themes.
-	The types of submissions solicited by the proposed workshop. The proposers are suggested to check the types of papers called for by the main ICTERI 2019 conference at its website.   
-	An estimation of potential interest to the workshop theme and the number of submissions
-	The names and affiliations of the workshop organizers, and the program committee
-	The information about previous offerings of the workshop (if any), including the attendance, the numbers of papers or presentations submitted and accepted, and the links to the corresponding websites and proceedings
-	Publicity plan for attracting submissions and attendees
-	Explanation of how the presentation of all accepted papers by the authors will be ensured
-	Important dates
It is recommended that the Workshops operate roughly within the timeline given in the Indicated Deadlines section (above).
Proposal Submission Guidelines
The language of the main ICTERI Conference is English. Workshop Proposals submitted in any other language will be rejected without review. 
Submissions should be made electronically in PDF format. The authors should use the ICTERI electronic submission system at https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=icteri2019 and submit their proposals to the ICTERI 2019 Workshop Proposals Track.

PUBLICATION OF WORKSHOP PROCEEDINGS
The organizers of the ICTERI Workshops may either publish their proceedings themselves, or apply for the publication of their accepted papers as a part of the ICTERI 2019 Conference Proceedings volume. This has to be clearly stated in the Workshop Proposal. 
Previously, the proceedings volumes of ICTERI series were published electronically at CEUR-WS (ISSN 1613-0073):
−	2012: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-848/  
−	2013: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1000/  
−	2015: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1356/ 
−	2016: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1614/ 
−	2017: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-1844/
−	2018: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2104/ 
The best workshop papers, among the accepted and presented at the conference, may be selected by the ICTERI steering committee and invited to be revised and extended for the ICTERI post-proceedings volume. The post-proceedings of ICTERI are traditionally published by Springer Communications in Computer and Information Science (CCIS) series. 
Alternatively, the best papers might be invited by Ukrainian and International Journals to be extended and revised for their special issues. ICTERI traditionally cooperates with the two Ukrainian journals: «Bulletin of V.N. Karazin Kharkiv National University» (http://mia.univer.kharkov.ua/); «Information Technology in Education» (http://ite.ksu.ks.ua/en/). 

PRESENTATION OF WORKSHOP PAPERS
Workshop organizers should also explain in their proposal how they ensure that all accepted papers are presented at their workshop. It is strongly recommended that all the papers accepted for an ICTERI 2019 workshop must be presented at the workshop session of the conference by one of their authors. The author who presents the paper must register and physically attend the conference. For those Workshops who choose publishing their proceedings as parts of ICTERI conference proceedings volume, the Program Chairs of ICTERI 2019 reserve the right to exclude the papers, which have not been presented, from the proceedings of ICTERI 2019.
