Due to advancements in technology and development of new services, we foresee a tremendous growth of new devices and smart things that need to be connected to the Internet through a variety of wireless technologies. At the same time, the edge of the Internet is increasingly empowered with new capabilities, like pervasive sensing and computing power, which opens the way to new domains, services and business models beyond traditional mobile Internet, such as connected cars, participatory and urban sensing, industrial IoT. As a consequence, new types of information have to be delivered by the network with varying requirements in terms of reliability, transmission rates and latency. To cope with the exponential growth of devices and mobile data traffic, there is a need for clean-slate or evolutionary Internet architectures merging and assembling different network technologies, supporting new paradigms for wired/wireless system planning and optimization, efficient transport over heterogeneous wireless access options, efficient and quality-aware content distribution, and new approaches for unified operations and management of the heterogeneous components, like software-defined systems and network function virtualization. These are only some examples of the challenges that are of interest to IFIP WWIC 2019. 
The IFIP WWIC 2019 conference takes a broader view to the merge of wired and wireless technologies and welcomes submissions from academia and industry that explore challenges and advances in architectures, algorithms, protocols, and technologies for a global wired/wireless Internet network. Papers that present original work, validated by experimentation, simulation, or analysis, are solicited. We also encourage work-in-progress and position papers that describe highly original ideas, present new directions, or have the potential to generate insightful provocative discussions. IFIP WWIC is a single-track conference which has reached, over the last 15 years, a high-quality level, which is reflected by the paper acceptance rate as well as the level of attendance. Following the conference tradition, there will be a best paper award. 

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:

- Anticipatory Mobile Networking 
- Architectures and protocols for unified operations and management in wired/wireless environments 
- Architectures and protocols for mobile edge/fog computing 
- Content-centric and user-centric networking in wired/wireless environments
