The Faculty of Science and Technology and the Research Support Office at Aarhus University (AU) organize the 2019 Marie Curie Master Class: an intensive two-day training workshop that supports invited nominees in applying for an AU-hosted Marie Curie Award - Individual Fellowship (MSCA-IF). Selected participants are offered full accommodation and travel support. The class takes place in May 14-16, 2019.
