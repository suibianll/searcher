DBWorld Message ﻿The Faculty of Science, Technology, and Communications (FSTC) of the University of Luxembourg (UL) has an opening for an Associate Professor (tenure track for Full Professor) (M/F) in Computer Science with a focus on Machine Learning.

The position is anchored within the Computer Science and Communications Research Unit (CSC).

• Ref: F1-50011608 (to be mentioned in all correspondence)
• Full-time position (40 hrs/week)
• Earliest starting date: Jan 2020
• Fixed-term contract: 5 years, upon a positive evaluation, perspective of a permanent position may be foreseen.
