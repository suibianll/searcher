Call for lightning talks and posters
   
DYnamic and Novel Advances in Machine Learning and Intelligent Cyber Security (DYNAMICS) Workshop
https://www.acsac.org/2018/workshops/dynamics/
Held in conjunction with the 2018 Annual Computer Security Applications Conference
Monday (Dec 3rd) and Tuesday (Dec 4th)
 
Lightning Talks:
Lightning talks are fast-paced and high-energy. These are back-to-back 5-minute presentations -- using multimedia, slides, or movies -- on just about anything. Talk about a recent success, energize people about a pressing issue, ask a question, start a conversation!
    
Lightning talks are an opportunity to get up and talk about what’s on your mind.
    
You can give several lightning talks if you have more than one topic.
   
Posters:
Posters are a way for DYNAMICS attendees to present early results, gain feedback from conference and workshop attendees, and spark discussion among conference and workshop participants. The intent is for these posters is similar to lightning talks in that they provide a venue in support of new ideas and newcomers to our community.
  
** The poster can be up to 36×48 inches / 91*122 cm.
