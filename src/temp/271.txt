The Second International Workshop on "Data Engineering meets intelligent food and COoking 
Recipes" (DECOR) aims to accelerate research in data science by providing a forum for the
latest innovations in the intersection of Data Engineering and Intelligent Food and
Cooking Recipes,concerning data and software organization, integration, and sharing.  This workshop is specifically focused on data science innovations that accelerate the
 integration, access, and sharing of digital objects in support of Intelligent Food and
 Cooking Recipes domain, which comprises not only the process of cooking,  but also
 includes intelligent methods for enhancing human-food interactions, 
ranging from devising technology, playful interactions, multisensory experience design, 
understanding cross-cultural food eating habits and perception, as well as  food choices
and health connections. Consequently, increasing the ability of influencing food eating
 habits and choices that promote, simultaneously, healthful eating-decisions and creative
new human-food interaction experiences.
