The School of Computing, Informatics, and Decision Systems Engineering (CIDSE) in the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at Arizona State University (ASU) seeks applicants for a full-time lecturer position beginning Fall 2019. This position is in primary support of the Software Engineering M.S. and B.S. programs on ASU?s Polytechnic Campus, but lecturers are expected to support the instructional mission of all CIDSE programs. CIDSE has locations on the Tempe and Polytechnic Campuses so some travel between locations should be expected.  In addition, CIDSE has an online presence and all faculty participate in the creation of curriculum and delivery of instruction in the online modality. This is a non-tenure track appointment at the rank of Lecturer with a renewable fixed-term academic year contract. Opportunities exist to augment the academic year salary by assisting with summer instruction.

The successful candidate for this position will have a demonstrated record of excellence in teaching that incorporates active and project-based learning plus an extensive knowledge of software engineering. Lecturers should have the ability to teach in multiple areas across the curriculum, including data structures and algorithms, programming languages, software security and information assurance, web and mobile applications, and computer systems and networks.  Lecturers also contribute to the service mission of the programs through student outreach activities, serve on committees and in industry engagement activities in support of CIDSE. Faculty are also expected to remain engaged in professional development and external service.

A minimum of a M.S. in Computer Science, Software Engineering, Computer Engineering or a related discipline is required by time of the appointment. Preference will be given to those candidates with a Ph.D. or near completion of a Ph.D. by time of the appointment with proven teaching skills in undergraduate education in both full-immersion and digital immersion formats. Professional experience in the areas of software application and systems development and a commitment to work collaboratively with a diverse student population is also desirable.

Review of applications will begin January 15, 2019; if not filled, reviews will occur on the 1st and 15th of every month thereafter until the search is closed.  Apply at https://hiring.engineering.asu.edu/
