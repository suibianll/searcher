https://easychair.org/cfp/TOOLS-50_1�



------------------------------

This new edition of the TOOLS conference series revives a tradition going back 50 conferences from 1989 to 2012. TOOLS was originally �Technology of Object-Oriented�Languages and Systems� and grew to encompass all innovative aspects of software technology. Many of today�s most important software concepts were first introduced there.�The 2019 TOOLS 50+1, taking place near Kazan, in Russia, continues the series in the same spirit of creativity, passion for everything software-related, combination of scientific�soundness and industrial applicability, and an open attitude welcoming all trends and communities in the field.

TOOLS 51 will be held in the week of October 14, 2019, �with the conference proper on October 15 to 17 (Tuesday to Thursday) and colocated events on the surrounding days.�Proposers of colocated events are welcome to contact organizers. The conference location is the �campus of Innopolis University, a new IT-only university, part of the recently�created Innopolis technology city near Kazan, one of the main historic centers of Russia, capital of Tatarstan and about 800 kilometers from Moscow, easily reached by domestic�and international flights as well as train. For an excellent conference experience, participants will be housed on site, and will benefit from tours of Kazan and neighboring�attractions. The conference organizers will provide travel and visa assistance.
