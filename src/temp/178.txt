TECHNOLOGICAL EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTE OF WESTERN GREECE
PATRAS, GREECE

July 15-17, 2019

The International Conference on Information, Intelligence, Systems and Applications (IISA) series offers a forum for the constructive interaction and prolific exchange of ideas among scientists and practitioners from different research fields such as computers, mathematics, physics, biology, medicine, chemistry, experimental psychology, social sciences, linguistics, and engineering having the goal of developing methodologies and tools for the solution of complex problems in artificial intelligence, biology, neuroscience, security, monitoring, surveillance, healthcare, sustainability in energy sources, governance, education, commerce, automation, robotics, optimization, image, speech and natural languages, and their integration.
IISA 2019 is the Tenth conference in the IISA series, technically co-sponsored by IEEE, BAIF, the University of Piraeus, The University of Patras and the Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece.
IISA 2019 Proceedings will be published by IEEE (pending approval)
The conference is intended as an international forum for researchers and professionals in all areas of Information, Intelligence, Systems, and Applications. We invite submissions of papers presenting high-quality original research and developments for the conference tracks listed below.
IISA 2019 is organized by the University of Piareus, the University of Patras and the Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece in Patras at the conference center of the Technological Educational Institute of Western Greece.
Patras is located at the North-West of the Peloponnese and is the regional capital of Western Greece. It constitutes a bustling city, proud to host renowned scientific, academic and research communities in the fields of Science, Technology and Intelligent Systems.
IISA2019 will last for three days and will feature tutorials, technical paper presentations, workshops, and distinguished keynote speeches.
