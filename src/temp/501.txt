ï¿½Paper Title :  Extending the Multidimensional Data Model to Handle
Complex Data Dear Colleague: We are pleased to announce the release of a new issue of Journal of Computing Science and Engineering (JCSE), published by the Korean Institute of Information Scientists and Engineers (KIISE). KIISE is the largest organization for computer scientists in Korea with over 4,000 active members. Journal of Computing Science and Engineering (JCSE) is a peer-reviewed quarterly journal that publishes high-quality papers on all aspects of computing science and engineering. JCSE aims to foster communication between academia and industry within the rapidly evolving field of Computing Science and Engineering. The journal is intended to promote problem-oriented research that fuses academic and industrial expertise. The journal focuses on emerging computer and information technologies including, but not limited to, embedded computing, ubiquitous computing, convergence computing, green computing, smart and intelligent computing, and human computing. JCSE publishes original research contributions, surveys, and experimental studies with scientific advances. Please take a look at our new issue posted at http://jcse.kiise.org. All the papers can be downloaded from the Web page.

However, most SPM allocation algorithms do not make use of the cache in parallel, so they cannot harness the full potential of the HSC architecture. In this paper, we explore six SPM allocation algorithms, including four heuristic-based algorithms and two optimal algorithms based on model checking. Our experimental results show that the greedy stack distance based allocation for energy (GSDA-E) can also reduce the energy by as much or by nearly as much as the optimal results attained by the optimal stack distance based allocation for energy (OSDA-E), while also achieving performance close to those of the OSDA and GSDA.

JCSE, vol. 12, no. 3, pp.91-105 [Paper Two] - Title: Exploring GPU Data Cache Leakage Management Techniques - Authors: Hao Wen and Wei Zhang - Keyword: GPU; Cache; leakage reduction; Two-level low power mode - Abstract In this paper, we study how to reduce cache leakage energy efficiently for GPU data caches (L1 and L2). The access pattern of GPU cache is different from that of the CPU, which usually has little locality and high miss rate. In addition, GPU can hide memory latency more effectively due to multi-threading. Because of the above reasons, we find it is possible to place cache lines of GPU data caches into the low power mode more aggressively than traditional leakage management for CPU caches that can reduce more energy leakage without significant performance degradation. In some cases, we find it is possible for the GPU to bypass the L1 data cache to save 100% energy leakage while generating better performance. Also, we propose to combine the drowsy and gated-VDD techniques that can exploit short and long access intervals to minimize energy leakage with insignificant performance overhead. Interestingly, we may achieve better performance for some benchmarks due to the different cache access patterns after applying the leakage reduction method.

In this paper, we first study the disjoint-path-cover properties of a bipartite cylindrical grid. Based on the findings, we prove that every bipartite toroidal grid, excluding the smallest one, has a paired many-to-many 3-disjoint path cover joining S = {s1, s2, s3} and T = {t1, t2, t3} if and only if the set S UT contains the equal numbers of vertices from different parts of the bipartition.

JCSE, vol. 12, no. 3, pp.115-126 [Paper Four] - Title: Vision-Based Blind Spot Monitoring Using Rear-View Camera and Its Real-Time Implementation in an Embedded System - Authors: Kyeong Hoon Jung and Kang Yi - Keyword: Advanced driver assistance system; Blind spot monitoring; Vehicle detection; Intelligent vehicle - Abstract Blind spot monitoring (BSM) is one of the essential functions of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). In this paper, we propose a vision-based monitoring algorithm to detect vehicles in a blind-spot area using a rear-view camera. Instead of moving around the whole image to search for a vehicle, we use well-defined detection windows with fixed position and size. And we used histogram of oriented gradients (HOG) and the support vector machine (SVM) to detect a vehicle in each detection window. When a vehicle is detected, we compute the motion vector of the vehicle to determine if it approaches the ego vehicle or not. The alarm signal is finally generated based on history of events. To evaluate performance of the BSM algorithm, we captured various kinds of sequences by using a rear-view camera. Experimental results reveal precision higher than 98% and recall higher than 99%. We also develop high-speed methods to improve processing speed while keeping performance degradation as minimal as possible. Implementation of this fast algorithm on a commercial embedded device validated real-time characteristics of the proposed BSM algorithm.
