***Goal***
Over the last few years, research on database and information system technologies has been rapidly evolving
thanks to the new paradigms of software and hardware adopted by modern scientific and more invasive
applications. Presently, a huge and heterogeneous amount of data can be efficiently collected, integrated, stored,
managed, andanalyzed for novel and more interesting data-driven applications. The growing relevance of
non-traditional domains such as bioinformatics, social networking, mobile computing, sensor applications,
smart cities, and gaming are generating increasing quantities of data complex in contents, heterogeneous
in formats and often order of Terabytes in amount. These novel domains result in articulate ecosystems that include
areas such as human resources,business processes, processes of data and information, IoT, mobile equipment etc.

This scenario provides unprecedented opportunities to work on exciting problems, but also raises many new challenges
for data management, storage, process and mining. Heterogeneous data collected from different sources should be
adequately combined, integrated and stored to ensure efficient and effective data exploration and understanding.
Moreover, while information sharing is essential in today’s business and social networks, such sharing should not violate
security and privacy requirements. Particular attention should also be devoted to the involvement of the end-user in
the entire process to enhance her/his exploitation and understanding of data and knowledge as well as to make
the user a valuable data provider. Data management and analytics solutions will perform better when users can interact
with systems and the systems take account of the cognitive and physiological characteristics of the people involved to
provide personalized data processing and analytics.

The aim of this special issue is to disseminate cutting-edge contributions from various application domains representing
new trends in the far reaching research areas of databases, information systems and data analytics. The special issue
is expected to include papers that span a wide range of topics in the field of data collection, integration, storage, mining,
knowledge, and visualization, from methodological, technological and applied data science innovation aspects.
Contributions in this special issue should be of interest to a large and varied cross-disciplinary audience of researchers
and practitioners involved or interested from different perspectives in this topic.

The special issue welcomes submissions of technical, experimental, methodological papers, application papers,
and papers on experience reports in real-life domains.

***Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:***
- Research challenges on data management and analytics
- Methodologies, models, algorithms, and architectures for data science
