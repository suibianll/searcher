QUAT 2018 - 5th International Workshop on Data Quality and Trust in Big Data QUAT 2018 The 5th International Workshop on Data Quality and Trust in Big Data (QUAT 2018) In conjunction with the 19th International Conference on Web Information Systems Engineering (WISE 2018), Zayed University, Dubai, United Arab Emirates, November 12-15, 2018 The workshop website is at: http://computing.du.se/quat/quat2018/. The problem of data quality in data processing, data management, data analysis, and information systems largely and indistinctly affects every application domain, especially at the era of "Big Data". "Big Data" has the characteristics of huge volume in data and a great variety of structures or no structure. "Big Data" is increased at a great velocity everyday and may be less trustable. The use of big data underpins critical activities in all sectors of our society. Many data processing tasks (such as data collection, data integration, data sharing, information extraction, and knowledge acquisition) require various forms of data preparation and consolidation with complex data processing and analysis techniques. Achieving the full transformative potential of "Big Data" requires both new data analysis algorithms and a new class of systems to handle the dramatic data growth, the demand to integrate structured and unstructured data analytics, and the increasing computing needs of massive scale analytics. The consensus is that the quality of data and the veracity of data have to span over the entire process of data collection, preparation, analysis, modelling, implementation, use, testing, and maintenance, including novel algorithms and usable systems.

Technologies to use big data do not only provide efficiency and value for firms, but do also challenge existing organizational structure and business models. Consequently, to what extent employees and management, but also external stakeholders, like customers, suppliers and other organizations, for instance, banks, trust both the technologies and the big data in themselves is critical. The fact that big data challenge those who have competence and power in a world without big data, resistance may occur. I will here, based on some empirical studies of several big Swedish firms, discuss the nature of this resistance. The firms were formed in the old economy, and are not firms, which would not have been possible in a non-digital market. The discussion of trust in big data will circle around the people, process and outcome, and I will highlight which challenges we need to manage and address in order to build trust in big data in incumbent firms." *********************************************************************************************************************************************** Call for Submissions / Topics of Interest The goal of this workshop is to provide an international forum for the researchers in the areas of web technology, e-services, social networking, big data, data processing, trust, sensor networking, and GIS to discuss and exchange their recent research findings and achievements. The workshop is expected to have two types of papers, regular ones and short ones, in order to attract the most up-to-date research results and research in progresses. Regular papers (12 pages), for up-to-date research results Short papers (6 pages), for research in progresses Topics include, but are not limited to, the following: Data quality Business intelligence and analytics Data quality in big data and conceptual models Data quality in health data, biological data, and medical data Data quality assessment, measures and improvement methodologies Data quality mining Privacy preserving data quality Quality in data collection, processing, and storage Quality in data science and business analytics Data quality on novel data management architectures (cloud, streaming data, ...) Data quality in environmental, transport, manufacture data Data quality in the web data Quality-aware analytics solutions Quality for data, information, and knowledge Quality of scientific, geographical, and biologic databases Information quality in information systems Information quality in geo-information systems (GIS) Quality in learning analytics Wireless sensor networking and its computation ... Trust issues Conflict resolution and data fusion Cleaning extremely large datasets Data scrubbing, data standardization, data cleaning techniques Trust in big data, Trust in social networking data, Trust distribution, propagation, and computation Identity and Trust Management Conceptual models and algebra for trust ...
