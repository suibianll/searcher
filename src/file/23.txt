Call for PhD Symposium
Deadline January 14th, 2019

â€”-

We invite contributions to the PhD Symposium session of The Web Conference 2019. PhD students are encouraged to submit their ongoing research related to the broad topic of the World Wide Web. The 2019 edition of the conference will celebrate the 30th anniversary of the Web and in this reflection point we especially welcome submissions related to studies that improve our understanding of the Web, introduce socio-technical advances that enhance Web platforms and technologies, and increase the possibilities of the Web for democratizing access to knowledge.

The goal of the PhD Symposium is to provide a platform for PhD students to present and receive feedback on their ongoing research. Students at different stages of their research will have the opportunity to present and discuss their research questions, goals, methods and results. The symposium aims to provide students guidance on various aspects of their research from established researchers and other PhD students working in research areas related to the World Wide Web. Finally, the symposium aims to enable PhD students to interact with other participants of The Web Conference and potential collaborators by stimulating the exchange of ideas and experiences.

At the conference, the PhD Symposium will include a dedicated session where the selected PhD students meet with fellow PhD students and experienced researchers and have a chance to present their PhD projects, provide, and receive feedback.

Two-page abstracts of the accepted submissions will be published in the Companion Proceedings of The Web Conference 2019 and will be made available through the ACM Digital Library.
