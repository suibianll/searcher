Tenure Track Assistant Professor position in Machine Learning
                            

Umeå University welcomes applications for a tenure track position as Assistant Professor in Computer Science with focus on machine learning at the Department of Computing Science. The position, which is established through the Wallenberg AI, Autonomous Systems and Software Program (WASP http://wasp-sweden.org/), comes with a substantial recruitment package. 


Work description
The primary focus is research on advanced machine learning techniques. Examples of research areas are representation learning and grounding, sequential decision-making and reinforcement learning, learning from small data sets, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), incremental learning, and multi-task/transfer learning. Although the expertise should primarily be in the core of machine learning, the applicant should ideally also have experience from applying the research in some application areas. 

The position offers stimulating and challenging tasks. A main criterion for employment is a strong commitment to research. The successful candidate will have an important role and large freedom in developing the area of machine learning at the department, both in research and in undergraduate and graduate education. The candidate is also expected to develop collaboration across institutional boundaries inside and outside the university and within WASP. 

The position includes a substantial recruitment package including full funding of two PhD candidates (four years each) and two post docs (two years each). 
The position is for 5 years, of which 80 % is for research and 20 % for pedagogical qualification/teaching.
The position is part of Umeå University’s tenure track system, which means that an Assistant Professor has the right to apply for promotion to a position as Senior Lecturer/Associate Professor.
